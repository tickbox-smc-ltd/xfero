## Stopping and Starting xfero

### Starting Xfero

Xfero is started by the xfero-service.

```service xfero-service start```

### Stoping Xfero

Xfero is stopped by the xfero-service.

```service xfero-service stop```

**NOTE:**

When a request to stop Xfero is issued, shut-down of the scheduler is not instantaneous. This is because it is necessary for the scheduler to allow all running threads to complete execution before closing.

A tidy close can take up to 5 minutes to complete.
