## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](coc.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 

#### Bug Reporting

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related issues and bug reports.

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

**Before submitting a bug report**

- Check the FAQs on the forum for a list of common questions and problems.
- Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How do I submit a bug report?**

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. So, create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

-    Use clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
-    Describe the exact steps taken to reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
-    Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
-    Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
-    Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
-    If the problem is related to performance, include a CPU profile capture and a screenshot with your report.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

-    Did the problem start happening recently or was this always a problem?
-    Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

-    Which version of Xfero are you using?
-    What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
-    Are you running Xfero in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions:

-    Check if there's already a package which provides that enhancement.
-    Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**How do I submit enhancement suggestions?**

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. So, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

-    Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-    Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
-    Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
-    Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Xfero users.
-    Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.
